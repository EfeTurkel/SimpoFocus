# Yearly Analytics Implementation Summary

## ✅ Implementation Complete

This document summarizes the yearly analytics feature implementation for SimpoFocus.

## What Was Built

### 1. Data Models ✅
- **FocusCategory.swift** - Enum for categorizing focus sessions
  - Categories: Untagged, Coding, Algorithms, Physics, Business, Misc
  - Each category has a unique icon and color
  - Fully localized in Turkish, English, and German

- **FocusSession.swift** - Model for individual focus sessions
  - Tracks: date, duration, category, coins earned
  - Codable for persistence
  - Each session has a unique UUID

### 2. Enhanced Timer Service ✅
- **PomodoroTimerService.swift** - Updated to track detailed session history
  - Added `sessionHistory: [FocusSession]` array
  - Added `selectedCategory: FocusCategory` for current session
  - Automatically creates FocusSession when focus completes
  - Persists all session data to UserDefaults
  - Backward compatible - preserves legacy `totalFocusMinutes` data

### 3. Analytics Engine ✅
- **AnalyticsCalculator.swift** - Comprehensive analytics processor
  - **Period Stats**: Today, Week, Month, Year, All-Time
  - **Category Breakdown**: Hours and percentages per category
  - **Best Records**: Best day, best week, best month, longest streak
  - **Heatmap Data**: Full year of daily activity data

### 4. UI Components ✅

#### Category Selection
- **CategoryPickerSheet.swift** - Beautiful category selector
  - Grid layout with category buttons
  - Visual category icons and colors
  - Smooth animations and transitions

#### Data Visualization
- **CategoryPieChart.swift** - Donut chart for category breakdown
  - Dynamic pie slices based on percentages
  - Color-coded by category
  - Legend showing hours and percentages

- **YearlyHeatmapView.swift** - GitHub-style contribution calendar
  - Full year view (12 months)
  - Color intensity based on focus hours
  - Interactive cells with tooltips
  - Monthly layout with day cells

#### Main Analytics View
- **YearlyAnalyticsView.swift** - Complete analytics dashboard
  - Year selector with navigation arrows
  - Quick stats cards (Today, Week, Month, Year, All-Time)
  - Category breakdown section with pie chart
  - Best records section with achievements
  - Yearly heatmap visualization
  - Consistent with app's design system

### 5. Integration ✅
- **FocusView.swift** - Updated to include category selection
  - Category selector button (shown during focus)
  - Sheet presentation for CategoryPickerSheet
  - Replaced StatsView with YearlyAnalyticsView

- **PersistenceController.swift** - Enhanced persistence
  - Saves/loads session history automatically
  - Saves/loads selected category
  - Reactive updates on data changes

### 6. Localization ✅
- **LocalizationManager.swift** - Complete translations added
  - Turkish: All categories and analytics strings
  - English: All categories and analytics strings
  - German: All categories and analytics strings

## Key Features

### Time Period Analytics
- **Today**: Current day statistics
- **This Week**: Last 7 days
- **This Month**: Last 30 days
- **This Year**: Selected year (navigable)
- **All Time**: Complete history including legacy data

### Category Tracking
- Sessions can be tagged with categories
- Visual breakdown with pie chart
- Percentage and hours per category
- Year-specific or all-time views

### Best Records
- Best single day performance
- Best week performance
- Best month performance
- Longest consecutive streak

### GitHub-Style Heatmap
- Full year visualization
- Color intensity: 0h (gray) → 4h+ (bright green)
- Monthly organization
- Interactive tooltips on tap

## Data Migration

The implementation is **fully backward compatible**:
- Existing users retain all `totalFocusMinutes` data
- Legacy data shows in "All Time" statistics
- New sessions are tracked with full detail
- No data loss during upgrade

## Files Created

```
forest/Models/
  ├── FocusCategory.swift          (New)
  └── FocusSession.swift            (New)

forest/Utilities/
  └── AnalyticsCalculator.swift     (New)

forest/Views/
  ├── CategoryPickerSheet.swift     (New)
  ├── CategoryPieChart.swift        (New)
  ├── YearlyHeatmapView.swift       (New)
  └── YearlyAnalyticsView.swift     (New)
```

## Files Modified

```
forest/Services/
  └── PomodoroTimerService.swift    (Enhanced with session tracking)

forest/Storage/
  └── PersistenceController.swift   (Added session history persistence)

forest/Localization/
  └── LocalizationManager.swift     (Added 20+ new translation keys)

forest/Views/
  └── FocusView.swift               (Added category selector, replaced StatsView)
```

## Design Principles

1. **Backward Compatibility**: Preserves all existing user data
2. **Performance**: Efficient calculations with lazy evaluation
3. **User Experience**: Smooth animations, intuitive navigation
4. **Consistency**: Matches existing app design language
5. **Localization**: Full support for 3 languages
6. **Data Privacy**: All data stored locally, no external services

## Usage Flow

1. **During Focus Session**:
   - User starts focus session
   - Can select/change category via category selector
   - Session completes and is saved with full details

2. **Viewing Analytics**:
   - Tap stats icon in FocusView
   - View comprehensive yearly analytics
   - Navigate between years
   - See category breakdown
   - View best records
   - Explore activity heatmap

## Testing Recommendations

1. Complete a few focus sessions with different categories
2. Navigate through different years in analytics
3. Verify category pie chart updates correctly
4. Check heatmap shows correct activity intensity
5. Test localization in all 3 languages
6. Verify backward compatibility with existing data

## Future Enhancements (Optional)

- Export analytics to CSV/PDF
- Custom category creation
- Weekly/Monthly summary notifications
- Goal setting per category
- Comparison between time periods
- Share achievements on social media
